## [Unreleased]

  - Visual sentiment tags with emoji indicators (📈 Bullish, 📉 Bearish, ➖ Neutral)
  - Sentiment summary in news panel header showing distribution

- **Custom Stock Symbols** - Users can now add and manage custom stock/ticker symbols
  - Add new symbols via the stock selector dropdown
  - Custom symbols are persisted in localStorage
  - Visual distinction for custom symbols (green badge)
  - Remove custom symbols with delete button
  - Works with both mock data and live API providers
- **ML-based Price Prediction Service** - New Python/PyTorch service for LSTM-based stock price predictions
  - Multi-layer LSTM neural network trained on historical OHLCV data
  - Automatic technical indicator calculation (20+ features)
  - CUDA/GPU acceleration support for fast training
  - REST API endpoints for training, prediction, and model management
  - Background training with progress tracking
  - 14-day price forecast with confidence intervals
  - Model persistence (save/load trained models)
- **ML Forecast Panel** in frontend to display AI predictions alongside technical analysis
- **Backend proxy** for ML service requests

### Fixed
- **Production deployment: Fixed container port mapping** - Frontend container was mapping to Vite dev server port (5173) instead of nginx production port (80), causing 500 errors on `/api/*` endpoints because requests weren't being proxied to the backend
- **Docker Compose port conflict** - Moved `ports` and `healthcheck` from base `docker-compose.yml` to override files to prevent array merging that caused duplicate port bindings
- **Development API proxy** - Changed `VITE_API_BASE_URL` from `localhost:3001` to `backend:3001` so the Vite proxy can reach the backend container via Docker's internal DNS
- **API keys not restored on page reload** - DataServiceProvider now loads stored API keys from localStorage on initialization, so news and other API-dependent features work immediately after page reload

### Added
- **Backend proxy server for Yahoo Finance API**
  - Node.js/Express backend service to avoid CORS issues
  - Proxy endpoints for Yahoo Finance chart and search APIs
  - Health check and version endpoints
  - Docker containerization with production and development Dockerfiles
  - nginx reverse proxy configuration to route `/api` requests to backend
  - Vite dev server proxy for local development
  - Backend service auto-starts with `docker compose up`
- **Backend proxy for NewsAPI** - Added `/api/news/everything` endpoint to proxy NewsAPI requests, because NewsAPI's free tier requires server-side requests (returns 426 from browser)

### Changed
- **Yahoo Finance is now the default data source** - Changed from mock data to Yahoo Finance as the default provider since it requires no API key and provides real market data
- Yahoo Finance provider now uses backend proxy instead of direct API calls
